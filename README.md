# Game_Recommendation_System

This system takes input from the user (his desired game) and compares the features of this game with all other games and suggests top 10 games to the user as output.
We used Cosine Similarity, which computes similarity between all pairs of items. It is a symmetrical algorithm, which means that the result from computing the similarity of Item A to Item B is the same as computing the similarity of Item B to Item A.
